# `0x32` MFL Volume (Buttons)

The **MFL** `0x50` uses the same command as **BMBT** `0xf0` for volume control.

The MFL's momentary buttons can only emulate the BMBT's rotary encoder output. They will emit a direction, but do not support velocity/rate of change. The "step" will always be `1` regardless of the rate at which the switch is used. 

Pushing the volume buttons at a higher frequency of use will simply send single step commands at a corresponding higher frequency. Holding the volume buttons down will continuously send the same command at a fixed rate.

The R/T mode has no effect on volume. Whether radio or telephone is the recipient of volume commands is based on [telephone status](../status.md); specifically the the "active", and "handsfree" bits being set (as per an active call on speakerphone).
