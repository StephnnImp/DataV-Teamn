- regardless of MENU or OVERLAY. The radio will still write to display... 
- it's not affected by which display GT is on, it will still write
- i guess the primary role of overlay is perhaps to show radio

BM53

- when hitting menu i get 0x46 twice with same value 0x01
- when hitting overlay i get 0x46 twice with split masks 0x02 and 0x0c

- however, turning radio off sends 0x46 ONCE... it's only for hide header 0x02

- AHHHHHH!
- it's the extra flags on 0x45 that determine whether radio sends 0x46 twice

- 45 01 => 46 TWICE
- 45 11 => 46 twice
- 45 81 => 46 twice

- 45 00 => 46 ONCE
- 45 10 => 46 ONCE
- 45 80 => 46 ONCE

- 45 02 => 46 once
- 45 0c => 46 once

- when bringing up TONE
- when radio rides.. it uses HIDE MENU 0b0000_1100 .. not 1 bit mask 0b0000_1000
- it's the same for soft SELECT
- HOWEVER, 0b0000_1000 still works if i generate a menu, then 46 08


- **does radio _ever_ send 0x00? can radio request relegating itself?**
- no, sending 0x46 0x00 doesn't bring radio up 

- **Question: does GT send 0x45 to radio to hide menu when radio is off???**
- NO- GT must know radio is off (if radio has written a title, it sends it)

**When the radio turns on, it will assume it has control of the display- I guess the user intent is inherent when turing the radio on.**

- BM53 remembers if overlay is up or not- that's what determines if it is foreground at power on

# `0x46` Request Radio UI

Radio `0x68` → GT `0x3b`

The radio has limited control of the display in order to manage it's own interface. With respect to control of the display, the radio is ultimately subserveant to the GT and it's UI state will always be overridden by `0x45`.

### Examples

    68 04 3B 46 01 10
    68 04 3B 46 02 13
    68 04 3B 46 04 15
    68 04 3B 46 08 19
    68 04 3B 46 0C 1D
    68 04 3B 46 0E 1F

## Parameters

Fixed length. One byte bitfield.

    PRIORITY      = 0b0000_0001
    HIDE_HEADER   = 0b0000_0010
    HIDE_BODY     = 0b0000_1100

### Priority `0b0000_0001`
    
    PRIORITY_RAD  = 0
    PRIORITY_GT   = 1

When set to `1`, the radio is relinquishing the display.

When set to `0`, the radio is managing it's own display functions (outlined below).

The radio `0x68` won't explictly set `0`- when the radio is turned on, the radio `0x68` will begin writing to the display, at which point, the GT `0x3b` is inherently aware of the radio `0x6b` being in the foreground.

### Hide Header `0b0000_0010`

    HIDE_HEADER = 0b0000_0010

### Hide Body `0b0000_1100`

    HIDE_BODY_SELECT   = 0b0000_0100
    HIDE_BODY_TONE     = 0b0000_1000
    HIDE_BODY_MENU     = 0b0000_1100

## Use Cases

### Main Menu

A MENU press does not get sent to radio, but is broadcast, and instead handled by the GT `0x3b`, which will in turn, message the Radio `0x68`, requesting it relegate itself to the background.

    F0 04 FF 48 34 77   # MENU button press
    3B 04 68 45 91 83   # GT (4-1/00) requesting radio relinquish foreground
    68 04 3B 46 01 10   # Radio relinquishing foreground

### Hide Overlay/Radio Off

When pressing the OVERLAY button, the radio relinquishes the display. The radio will still write titles, but automatically hide overlay again after 8 seconds

#### BM C23

Unlike a MENU button press, the OVERLAY button press is sent directly to the radio.

    # BMBT Overlay button press
    F0 04 68 48 30 E4

    # Radio exits overlay mode:
    68 04 3B 46 0E 1F   # 0b0000_1110

The radio will still write titles, but relinquish the display again after the timeout:

    # Radio writes to display: "FM ☐101.1☐   "
    68 12 3B 23 40 20 46 4D 20 03 31 30 31 2E 31 04 20 20 20 21
    
    # 8 seconds pass...
    
    # Radio automatically hides overlay
    68 04 3B 46 0E 1F

#### BM53

    # BMBT Overlay button press
    F0 04 68 48 30 E4

    # Radio exits overlay mode
    68 04 3B 46 02 13   # 0b0000_0010
    68 04 3B 46 0C 1D   # 0b0000_1100
    
Radio writes titles while in background.

    # "☐ 89.3☐      "
    68 .. 3b 23 62 10 "☐ 89.3☐      " ..
    
    # 8 seconds pass
    
    68 04 3B 46 02 13
    68 04 3B 46 0C 1D

### Hide Select

The radio doesn't have to redraw the menu, it's cached in the GT.
