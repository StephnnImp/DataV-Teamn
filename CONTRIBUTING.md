# Contributing

## Getting Started

If you would like to contribute to this project:

1. Open an [issue](https://github.com/piersholt/wilhelm-docs/issues) to discuss what you'd like to contribute. Some documentation may already be in development, so it's best to confirm the contribution before getting started. 

1. Please use refer to this [format guide](template.md). The documentation format has admittedly changed over time and continues to evolve, however this guide reflects the current format.

1. I would ask that contributions are limited to completed documentation. If you need assistance to complete a piece of documentation, open an issue and I will do my best to answer any questions.

1. When you're ready to submit your contribution:
    1. make a PR for each documentation topic, i.e. a PR for each command
    1. name the PR as per the document title, e.g. *"0xID Command Name"*

## Notes

1. Please do not submit documentation that has been transposed from another source, irrespective of licensing or copyright.

1. Be prepared to have your documentation modified to some degree.

1. I have a great deal of time for those with questions. If you are unsure of something- ask!
