# `0x13` Sensors

Cluster `0x80` -> Broadcast `0xbf`

*Note: this covers the shorter version of this command as introduced with the IKE.*

## Parameters

Fixed length. 3 byte bit field.

    HANDBRAKE       = 0b0000_0001 << 16
    OIL_PRESSURE    = 0b0000_0010 << 16
    BRAKE_PADS      = 0b0000_0100 << 16
    TRANSMISSION    = 0b0001_0000 << 16
    
    IGNITION        = 0b0000_0001 << 8
    DOOR            = 0b0000_0010 << 8
    GEAR            = 0b1111_0000 << 8

    AUX_VENT        = 0b0000_1000

---

### Handbrake `0b0000_0001 << 16`

Microswitch located on the handbrake mechanism.

    HANDBRAKE_OFF    = 0
    HANDBRAKE_ON     = 1

### Oil Pressure `0b0000_0010 << 16`

This mirrors the cluster's oil pressure warning lamp behaviour. As such, a fault will be indicated at KL-15 until ignition, at which point oil pressure (should) be obtained.

    OIL_PRESSURE_OK     = 0
    OIL_PRESSURE_FAULT  = 1
    
### Brake Pads `0b0000_0100 << 16`

    BRAKE_PADS_OK     = 0
    BRAKE_PADS_FAULT  = 1

### Transmission `0b0000_0100 << 16`

*Transmission Emergency Program*.

    TRANSMISSION_OK     = 0
    TRANSMISSION_FAULT  = 1
   
---

### Ignition `0b0000_0001 << 8`

Denotes that the engine is running.

    IGNITION_OFF    = 0
    IGNITION_ON     = 1     # Engine running

### Door `0b0000_0010 << 8`

Replicates the driver's door open field of `0x7a`.

    DOOR_CLOSED = 0
    DOOR_OPEN   = 1     # Driver's door open

### Gear `0b1111_0000 << 8`

Only at KL-15 and above. Presumably doesn't apply to manual transmissions, but may apply to SMG.

    GEAR_NONE       = 0b0000_0000   # KL-30/KL-R
    GEAR_PARK       = 0b1011_0000
    GEAR_REVERSE    = 0b0001_0000
    GEAR_NEUTRAL    = 0b0111_0000
    GEAR_DRIVE      = 0b1000_0000
    GEAR_FIRST      = 0b0010_0000
    GEAR_SECOND     = 0b0110_0000
    GEAR_THIRD      = 0b1101_0000
    GEAR_FOURTH     = 0b1100_0000
    GEAR_FIFTH      = 0b1110_0000
    GEAR_SIXTH      = 0b1111_0000   # Only a guess!

---

### Aux. Ventilation `0b0000_1000`

This is what activates aux. ventilation.

    AUX_VENT_OFF    = 0
    AUX_VENT_ON     = 1

## Use Cases

### Check Control (High Cluster)

> The check control receives information from the IKE for the following messages.

> - Transmission emergency program
- Release parking brake- Check brake pad- Stop! Engine oil pressure
