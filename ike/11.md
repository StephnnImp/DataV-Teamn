# `0x11` Ignition

Cluster `0x80` â†’ Broadcast `0xbf`

The cluster will broadcast the ignition status:

 - when the ignition switch position changes
 - periodically while at KL-R (position 1) or greater
 - periodically at KL-30 (position 0) while bus remains active
 - in response to a module announcement `0x02`
 - in reply to a ignition request `0x10`
 
A number of modules will not activate unless the required ignition status is broadcast by the cluster. For example, while the navigation computer has a KL-R supply circuit, it will not wake until the cluster broadcasts a KL-R ignition status.

##### Check your fuses!

It's not the ignition switch position itself that drives the ignition status, but the associated supply circuit to the cluster that the switch closes. Thus, if the applicable supply is not closed due to a blown fuse, the cluster will not broadcast the applicable igntition status.
