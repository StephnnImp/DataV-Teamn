## Addresses

- 8-bit addressing (256 unique addressess).
- Addresses are preallocated, and remain fixed.
- Multicast, and broadcast addresses.
- All buses are within the 8-bit scope, i.e. an address is unique across the I, K, and D buses.
- The adress pool is shared by all models that utilise this bus system. i.e. once the address `0x69` was allocated to the E31 body module, it was not reallocated, even on models to which the device was not applicable to.
- Variants of a device will have the same address, e.g. the address `0x80` is used by the low cluster (KOMBI), high clusters (IKE, IKI).
