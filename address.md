## Addresses

- 8-bit addressing
- Addresses are assigned fro
- Addresses are programed from the factory
- The addresses are preprogramed from the factory

- Device addresses are preprogramed from the factory
- The 8-bit address pool is shared between every model that utilises this bus system. e.g. once the address `0x69` was allocated to the elektronic bodymodule of the E31, it was not used again, even on models to which the device was not applicable to.
