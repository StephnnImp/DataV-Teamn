# `0x02` "Pong"

This command has two purposes:

1. Annoucing the presence of a module on the bus.
2. "Pong" in response to a "Ping" `0x01`.

## Use Cases

### Announce

The announce bit is set when a module becomes active on the bus. This is most frequently seen at ignition with modules commonly powered/activated by ignition circuits (KL-R, KL-15).

    C8 04 FF 02 31 00       # Telephone broadcasting an announcement

The announcement is what determines the availability of numerous features. For example, Television, Telephone, and DSP will all appear in the BMBT main menu following the announcement by the respective modules.

An annoucement also allows the new module to establish it's state. and any applicable modules will respond as necessary. The response will depend on the announcing module, but will at minimum, include ignition state `0x11` from the cluster.

### "Pong"

After a module has announced, it's ongoing presence will be checked by interested modules via `0x01` "Ping".
    
    C8 04 FF 02 31 00   # Telephone broadcasts announcement
    [...]
    50 03 C8 01 9A      # MFL pings Telephone
    C8 04 50 02 30 AE   # Telephone replies to MFL with a pong
    
    ED 04 FF 02 01 15   # TV broadcasts announcement
    [...]
    3B 03 ED 01 D4      # BMBT pings TV
    ED 04 3B 02 00 D0   # TV replies to BMBT with a pong

If the ping is not acknowledged, features will be disabled. For example, the availability of the "Television" menu item requires the TV continue to reply to pings.

### Module Variant Identification

In the case that a module has variants, and that variant affects behaviour of other modules on the bus, a "signature" is used to allow variants to be identified.

A good working example of this is the BMBT which was introduced with the 4x3 display, and was later upgraded to the larger 16x9 display. In order for the navi. computer/video module to output a video signal with the correct aspect ratio, it must be able to identify the BMBT variant.

#### GT `0x3b`

Module|Variant|Signature|Frame|
:---|:---|:---|:---|
GT|Video Module GT|`0x10`|`3B 04 FF 02 11 D3`
GT|Nav. GT (incl. MK1)|`0x40`|`3B 04 BF 02 41 C3`

Nav.|MK4? + BMW Assist|`0xc0`|`7F 04 BF 02 C1 07`

- telephone to presumably configure BMW Assist
- may affect MRS and sending impact notification

#### Telephone `0xc8`

Module|Variant|Signature|Frame|
:---|:---|:---|:---|

Telephone|Everest Module with Bluetooth|`0x38`|`C8 04 BF 02 38 49`

- nav. computer will send telematics data `0xa2`, `0xa4`

#### BMBT `0xf0`

Module|Variant|Signature|Frame|
:---|:---|:---|:---|
BMBT|4x3|`0x00`|`F0 04 BF 02 01 48`
BMBT|16x9|`0x30`|`F0 04 BF 02 31 78`

- GT/VM will set correct aspect ratio and encoding.

#### No Variants

While the need for a signature is likely predicated upon a module hardware/software revision, *it's only in the case that the module must be differentiated on the bus that a signature will be used*. Some modules, despite having one or more revisions, will not distinguish variants.

The following module variants do not appear to have a signature.
