# `0x39` CDC Status

CDC `0x18` â†’ Radio `0x68`

*CDC as introduced- not MP3!*

This command is one half of the CD changer playback control- the other being CDC Request `0x38`. It is used by the CDC changer to report it's status to the radio.

The CDC in my 2001 540i introduced four additional bytes to this command. However, in my testing, the values of said four bytes never changed; as such, I've not covered it.

    # CD Changer (2001), Radio: BM53
    18 0E 68 39 00 82 00 01 00 01 03 00 01 01 01 C7
    18 0E 68 39 02 89 00 01 00 01 09 00 01 01 01 C4
    18 0E 68 39 01 8C 00 01 00 01 01 00 01 01 01 CA
    18 0E 68 39 04 89 00 01 00 01 13 00 01 01 01 D8

## Parameters

Fixed length. 7 data bytes.

Parameter|Index|Length|Type
:--------|:----|:-----|:---
Status   |`0`  |`1`   |Bitfield
Audio?   |`1`  |`1`   |Bitfield
Error    |`2`  |`1`   |Bitfield
Magazine |`3`  |`1`   |Bitfield
Unknown  |`4`  |`1`   |Unknown
Disc     |`5`  |`1`   |Integer (BCD)
Track    |`6`  |`1`   |Integer (BCD)

### Status

    0x00: Stopped
    0x01: Paused
    0x02: Playing
    0x03: FFW
    0x04: RWD
    0x05: Next Track
    0x06: Previous Track
    0x07: Pending/Acknowledge
    0x08: Magazine Ready
    0x09: Magazine Checking
    0x0a: Magazine Ejected

### Audio?

The apparent partial duplication of the Status byte suggests this has a different use. Possibly to do with flagging when CD changer is outputting audio?

    # CD Changer (1997)
    0x02: Stopped
    0x09: Playing
    0x0c: Ready?

For reference, the later CDC does distinguish itself here.

    # CD Changer (2001)
    # Ostensibly as per CDC (1997) but with an additional flag 0x80 (0b1000_0000) set.
    0x82: Stopped
    0x89: Playing
    0x8c: Ready?

### Error

Based on the incontiguous (sic) values, I presume there's other errors I've not seen in testing.

I'd guess this is a basic bitfield (i.e. 8 flags), rather than combination bitfield.

    0x02: High Temp
    0x08: No Disc
    0x10: No Magazine

### Magazine

This denotes which slots in the CD changer magazine are loaded with a disc.

    MAGAZINE_SLOT_1 = 0b0010_0000
    MAGAZINE_SLOT_2 = 0b0001_0000
    MAGAZINE_SLOT_3 = 0b0000_1000
    MAGAZINE_SLOT_4 = 0b0000_0100
    MAGAZINE_SLOT_5 = 0b0000_0010
    MAGAZINE_SLOT_6 = 0b0000_0001

### Unknown

I've only ever seen this with a value of `0x00`.

### Disc

Integer.

I've not confirmed the encoding here. The MK1 GT applies a mask to the CD changer display which only allows a single digit for CD number, so it's somewhat moot.

    # Example: CDC Disc No. 9
    18 .. 68 39 00 09 00 00 00 09 05 ..         # Disc: 0x09
    68 .. 3b 23 cb 20 43 44 20 35 2D 30 39 ..   # "CD 9-05"

### Track

Integer. Binary coded decimal.

    # Example: CDC Track No. 12
    18 .. 68 39 02 09 00 01 00 01 12 ..         # Track 0x12
    68 .. 3b 23 c4 20 43 44 20 31 2D 31 32 ..   # "CD 1-12"
    
    # Example: CDC Track No. 16
    18 .. 68 39 00 02 00 01 00 01 16 ..         # Track 0x16
    68 .. 3b 23 c4 20 43 44 20 31 2D 31 36 ..   # "CD 1-16"

## Use Cases

I haven't been exhaustive here as the behaviour can be a little inconsistent between radios/CD changers. I've attempted to highlight a few 'gotchas'.

### Acknowledge

The radio and CD changer have a tumultuous relationship...

When the radio issues a CDC Request `0x38`, it expects a **specific** response. Not only that, the radio expects a **prompt** response.

If the radio does not receive a timely, correct reply, it will effectively berate the CD changer until it receives it. As such, in the event that the CD changer can't immediately perform the requested action, i.e. the disc needs to spin up, the CD changer issues an acknowledgement of sorts, thus satisfying the radio's need for a timely response.

When able, the CD changer replies again with a status that reflects the radio request.

    68 05 18 38 03 00 4E                    # Oi, CDC, start playing!
    18 0A 68 39 07 09 00 01 00 01 02 4F     # Yes, sir, I'm on it, stand by!
    
    # Time passes...
    
    18 0A 68 39 02 09 00 01 00 01 02 4A     # Playing, sir!


Similarly, if the CDC speaks out of turn, i.e. when the radio is supposed to be off, and the CDC says anything other than "Stopped", the radio will repeatedly yell at the CDC to stop.

### No Disc

    # Based on last 0x39 update, the radio is aware that
    # the magazine does not have discs in slots 3 and 4
    18 .. 68 39 02 09 00 33 00 02 01 ..
    
    # Thus, when user presses "3" on BMBT (to load disc 3)...
    f0 .. 68 48 12 ..
    
    # The radio can display "NO DISC" on display
    68 .. 3b 23 c2 20 4E 4F 20 44 49 53 43 .. # "NO DISC"

### No Magazine/CD Check

    # Ejecting magazine while CD playing
    18 .. 68 39 0A 02 00 3F 00 00 00 ..                   # CDC: Magazine Eject(ing)
    68 .. 3b 23 c1 20 4E 4F 20 4D 41 47 41 5A 49 4E 45 .. # "NO MAGAZINE"
    
    # Let's turn radio off while magazine out for shits and giggles
    f0 .. 68 4b 06 30 ..                                  # [Power] Press
    68 .. f0 4a 00 ..                                     # Radio LED off
    
    # Let's turn it back on with magazine still out
    f0 .. 68 4b 06 30 ..                                  # [Power] Press
    68 .. f0 4a ff ..                                     # Radio LED on
    
    # Radio remembers last CDC state
    68 .. 3b 23 c1 20 4E 4F 20 4D 41 47 41 5A 49 4E 45 .. # "NO MAGAZINE"
    
    # Radio checking in to see what's up, but still no magazine
    68 .. 18 38 00 00 ..                                  # Radio: Get CDC status
    18 .. 68 39 0A 02 00 3F 00 00 00 ..                   # CDC: Magazine Eject(ed)
    
    # Let's load the magazine back in
    18 .. 68 39 09 02 00 3F 00 00 00 ..                   # CDC: Magazine Checking
    68 .. 3b 23 c3 20 43 44 20 43 48 45 43 4B ..          # "CD CHECK"
    
    # Magazine loaded. go time!
    18 .. 68 39 08 02 00 3F 00 00 00                      # CDC: Magazine Ready
    68 .. gt 23 c4 20 43 44 20 20 2D 20 20                # "CD  -  "
    68 .. 18 38 03 00                                     # Play!
